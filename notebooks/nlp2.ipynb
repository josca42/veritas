Today , at the heyday of the digital age , we find we ’re so used to it that sometimes we do n’t even notice it anymore : for example , when did you last pay attention to the background soundtrack in a movie or a video game ? During 2020-2021 , the pandemic has accelerated the trend for digitization . Many believe that metaverse – a virtual space where we will interact with each other and the environment with the help of VR and AR technologies – is the next logical step in this process . Let ’s look into how music can be integrated within the broader narrative of the metaverse and help musicians of any level create new experiences for their audience . ## NFTs , Empowering Music During the past year , decentralized technologies have been seeping into music . Non-fungibles , for one , are increasingly seen as a novel way of distributing audio and video content . At the same time , blockchain technology opens new potential for protecting and exchanging digital property rights . For artists , especially emerging talents , NFTs represent a viable new way of raising funds . Modern NFT platforms specializing in different aspects of music production , from funding to distribution , help them reach their audience , raise funds for their next tracks , and put the music out there for their fans to enjoy . Fans , in their turn , get a chance to support their favorite artists and experience material and emotive rewards . The latter is most in tune with the very spirit of music fanship : NFTs find a cozy nook in our mental libraries of emotions , memories , affiliations , and ‘ that-itches.’ Eric Elliot with Greenruhm.com says in his article , ‘ we ’re not buying JPGs . We ’re buying membership , identity , status , and a sense of ownership . And it ’s addictive AF.’ According to the metaverse advocates , the new virtual worlds are bound to create an even more immersive – and addictive – experience . ## Brought Together by the Metaverse A great part of enjoying music is forming connections with your favorite artists and other fans : millions have been hungry for during the last two years of the pandemic . We all want to belong and share experiences . This is the reason why we collect merchandise , go to concerts or festivals , hunt for autographs , and join meet-and-greet events . Metaverse is all about the community , as well : we do need allies and opponents to enjoy play-to-earn games truly , we want others to appreciate our NFT collections , and so on . The first cases from the metaverse are jaw-dropping . Amelia Kallman shares amazing stats : ‘ watching Travis Scott live in Fortnite … , was not one big group of 12.3 million people , but instead , the concerts were made up of 50 people each.’ Thus , ‘ essentially , there was n’t one concert , but 250,000 co-occurring.’ This fosters much more engagement than lockdown-induced YouTube videos of a show performed in an empty venue , right ? And talking about merchandise , what concert-goer does n’t love those amazing merch cannons ? Lil Nas X has pioneered the way with his Roblox concert , distributing the ‘ merchandise that far outpaced their initial expectations , citing an eight-figure rate , ’ as The Guardian reports . ‘ Limits are non-existent in the metaverse , ’ claims Jon Vlassopulos , global head of music of video game developer Roblox . ## Sounds of the Wild Meta Frontiers As we see , metaverse creates new opportunities for connection and immersion . However , for now , we are still just scratching the surface . According to Simon Powell from Jefferies , we ’re at least a decade away from a unified metaverse , and there ’s still much work to be done around hardware , software and then bringing the metaverse to the mainstream . It will require boosting interoperability to connect separate parts of the metaverse , creating a viable infrastructure for this new world , and doing some work on the legal aspect to create a cohesive experience similar to how users click between websites and apps . However , given the amount of attention coming from tech giants such as Facebook , Microsoft , and Nvidia , we are sure to see wider adoption and innovation next year and beyond .
